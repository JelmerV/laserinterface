# Callbacks are the event that happen when a specific gpio value changes.
# The name defines when it gets called. Use one of the the following:
#   {OUT/IN}_{NAME/ANY}_{ON/OFF/ANY}
#   TEMP_{RED/ORANGE/GREEN}
#   JOB_{START/STOP/PAUSE}
#
# The outputs that should be toggled are specified with:
#     OUT_{NAME}: {ON/OFF/EQUAL/OPPOSITE}
#     SEND_GRBL: {HOLD/CONTINUE}
#
# if output/input with that name changes to the specified value, all of the
# following items will be set to the new value.
CALLBACKS:
  # The following rule ensures the cooling and the exhaust are always on
  # when the laser is turned on.
  OUT_LASER_ON:
    OUT_COOLING: ON
    OUT_EXHAUST: ON

  # the next example switches the air assist to be on when the laser is on,
  # and off, when the laser turns off
  OUT_LASER_ANY:
    OUT_AIR: EQUAL

  # halt grbl when an input switched off (door opened, no water flowing, etc.)
  IN_ANY_OFF:
    SEND_GRBL: HOLD
